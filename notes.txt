Research Question:
"At what time of the day do people express laughter the most?"

Hypothesis
"I suspect that people will express laughter the most at around 7PM, 
since studies have shown that people are happiest at this time of the day"


files are saved in the following format:
year|month|day:hour.out.gz
without the pipe simbols, example:
20220106:03.out.gz

# echos a random month and day in 2022 with hour 14, some formatting is required to use this as filename
# RANDOM with mod shouldn't be used for research though because of pigeon-holing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)
echo "2022 $((1 + RANDOM % 12)) $((1 + RANDOM % 31)) : 14"
# example output:
2022 6 13 : 14

files are stored in the following structure:
Tweets/<year>/<month>/<files>



things that express laughter / happiness:
"hahaha" or variations
":)"
"XD" or variations
"lol" or variations

shortcomings:
sarcasm / irony
someones start of the day might be different from others
have to choose one month across different years

data I need to collect:
time of day (hour)
the number of tweets in that hour
the number of tweets in that hour that express laughter
need to check that the tweet was sent from the correct timezone

ways I can display the data:
In a graph with percentage on the vertical axes and time of day on the horizontal axes
