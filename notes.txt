Research Question:
"At what time of the day do people express laughter the most?"

Hypothesis
"I suspect that people will express laughter the most at around 7PM, 
since studies have shown that people are happiest at this time of the day"


files are saved in the following format:
year|month|day:hour.out.gz
without the pipe simbols, example:
20220106:03.out.gz

dates that I will be using: 16/06/year and 16/12/year


things that express laughter / happiness:
"hahaha" or variations
":)"
"XD" or variations
"lol" or variations

shortcomings:
sarcasm / irony
someones start of the day might be different from others
have to choose one month across different years

data I need to collect:
time of day (hour)
the number of tweets in that hour
the number of tweets in that hour that express laughter
need to check that the tweet was sent from the correct timezone

ways I can display the data:
In a graph with percentage on the vertical axes and time of day on the horizontal axes


data has been collected in the following format:
- one day and month combination per file (16/06 or 16/12)

hour/day/month/year
number of tweets that express laughter
total number of tweets
whiteline

future research might be about how the time of the year affects happiness

--- weird things about the corpus and karora server---
data from april 15th 2013 at 1700 hours to april 17th 2013 1200 hours is missing, more months and years have missing data
16/01/2015 has missing data too
karora does not like it if the tweet2tab tool is being called 20 times at once as it has high CPU usage
