## The Repo
This repository houses a script that counts the number of occurrences of the word 'de', case insensitively. It is also used as a place for version control of the script

## The Program
The script can be downloaded and executed by doing the following in a linux shell:  
```
git clone https://github.com/DigitalHungerTM/resmeth
cd resmeth
./sample.sh rugwiki.txt
```
The script can be executed on any txt file by using `./sample.sh <filename>.txt`

## The RUG Wiki
The rugwiki.txt file is a direct .txt download of the webpage https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen
